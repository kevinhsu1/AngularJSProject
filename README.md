# AngularJSProject

This is a practice UI project that manages customers and orders. This project utilized AngularJS and SASS, and a couple unit test cases written in Jasmine.

The project has no back-end service. I basically hard-coded the data result from the service in the service file in the project. 

The project is developed in visual studio community 2013. Open the project with visual studio, right click on "Index.html", and select "View in Browser"
